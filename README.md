# BarterMillionaire
CLI game about making a million dollars with trade


Using this as a way to work on my BasicParse project.

You are a merchant and you want to make a fortune. The goal of the game is to become a millionare, but be wary of sitting on your thumbs too long.

Gameplay:

  Buy and sell from stores.
  once done with a store go to a new store. This counts as a new day
  Pay upkeep for how many items you are "storing" overnight
  Buy and sell with the new store and hope to make a profit
  
  
 Commands:
 TBD
